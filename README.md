# Tugas Besar IF2220 Probabilitas dan Statistika - Statistical Analysis of Grapes
## General Information
This project aims to get a thorough analysis of the characteristics of grapes grown in a particular region using statistical methods. The data used for this analysis was collected from a sample of 1000 grapes harvested in a vineyard in the region.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains the following variables:
<li> **Fixed acidity**: Refers to the total amount of acids, primarily tartaric acid, present in the grape juice. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li>

<li> **Volatile acidity** : Refers to the amount of acetic acid and other volatile acids present in the grape juice, which contribute to the sourness or vinegar-like taste of wine. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li>
  
<li> **Citric acid** : Refers to the amount of citric acid present in the grape juice. Citric acid is a natural acid found in many fruits and can contribute to the tartness and acidity of the wine. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li>
  
<li> **Residual sugar** : Refers to the amount of sugar remaining in the wine after fermentation. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li> 

<li> **Chlorides** : Refers to the amount of salt present in the wine. Chlorides can contribute to a salty taste and can also impact the perception of the wine's body and mouthfeel. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li>

<li> **Free sulfur dioxide** : Refers to the amount of sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) that is not bound to other molecules in the wine. SO2 is added to wine as a preservative and antioxidant, and also helps to inhibit the growth of bacteria and other. </li>

<li> **Total sulfur dioxide** : Refers to the total amount of SO2 present in the wine, including both free and bound forms. This is measured in parts per million (ppm). </li>

<li> **Density** : Refers to the mass of the wine per unit volume, typically measured in grams per milliliter (g/mL). The density of wine can be impacted by factors such as the sugar and alcohol content, and can also provide information about the wine's body and mouthfeel. </li> 
  
<li> **PH** : Refers to the acidity or basicity of the wine, with lower pH values indicating higher acidity. pH can impact the wine's taste, color, and stability, and is measured on a scale of 0 to 14. </li>
  
<li> **Sulphates** : Refers to the amount of sulfur compounds, other than SO2, present in the wine. Sulphates can contribute to the wine's flavor and aroma, and may also help to prevent spoilage. This is measured in grams per liter (g/L). </li>

<li> **Alcohol** : Refers to the percentage of alcohol present in the wine by volume. Alcohol content can impact the wine's taste, aroma, and body, and is typically measured as a percentage by volume (%ABV). </li>

<li> **Quality** : Refers to a subjective rating of the wine's overall quality, as determined by a panel of expert tasters. The quality rating is typically on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating better quality. </li>

### Analysis
The following statictical analyses were performed on the dataset:
- Descriptive statistics: Calculating the mean, median, standard deviation, and range of each variable in the dataset.
- Normality tests on each variable in the dataset.
- Calculating certain hypotheses given by using z-test.
